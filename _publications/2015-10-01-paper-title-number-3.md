excerpt: 'My PhD thesis goes through straight segment detection on images, all the way through matching them between images, up to the automated creation of 3D representations from these detected primitives. My contributions have applicability in the detection of shapes in images, feature matching and Structure-From-Motion based on groups of images.'

In this section I tried to chop my research career in 3 different stages.

## Post-Doctorate years

Development of Computer Vision and communication applications, design of \textbf{gimbal}-based onboard surveillance systems for firefighting and SAR mission aircrafts. Development of software for the control and configuration of onboard gimbal-mounted camera systems (visible, IR, multispectral). Aerial image orthorectification techniques. Detection of shapes. Photogrammetry. Projection onto 3D terrain. I set the requirements and assessment for onboard and cloud systems for surveillance in the largest fleet of helicopters for Emergency Services in Spain, including firefighting and sea-rescue. Working with \textbf{military-grade sensing systems} and \textbf{coordinating research groups} in different universities keeps me updated in the state of the art. \textbf{Equipment}: Trakka gimbals, with InfraTec and FLIR thermographic cameras, Sony visible cameras, Microstrain navigation solutions (inertial sensors), GPS, Iridium-based modem devices, SVP Broadcast Microwave H265 Aerial Video Transmission, Centum AIS and Lifeseeker. Work under ISO 9001 based standards.
While still affiliated to USC, I 

## PhD years

I succeeded publishing the required papers in Q1-ranked journals and presented my work in international congresses. I \textbf{defended and published my PhD thesis in 2019}, awarded with \textbf{Cum Laude}. Refer to the details in in the \textit{Publications} section of this CV.\\I designed, implemented and analyzed my own methods and algorithms. I validated my contributions from experiments performed using my own code, which I developed myself in C++ and Python for Linux/Windows/Mac to work in real-time with Parrot drones. My software performs feature extraction in images, real-time processing of streamed video from the vehicle, and finally 3D environment abstraction using points, lines and targets. I registered my software through the USC transfer office.

My side hustle during my PhD years was closely related with the research and experimental work I was doing in the University. Doing technical support in laboratories got me familiar with rapid prototyping. I have also taught programming for Raspberry Pi with OpenCV and sensors. I have also taught students how to pilot different kinds of fixed wing aircraft and multicopters equipped with ArduPilot, same as I was doing for the experimental part of my research work.

Globally, what I learnt was:
* Learnt advanced C++
* Designed my own algorithms
* Implemented my code.

## Early Stage Researcher

* Learnt  more advanced object-oriented coding.
* Learnt C++
 - Examples: OpenFoam solvers
* Designed my own algorithms
* Implemented my code.

## Fresh master graduate
* Learnt  more advanced object-oriented coding.

## Buttons

Make any link standout more when applying the `.btn` class.

## Notices

**Watch out!** You can also add notices by appending `{: .notice}` to a paragraph.
{: .notice}

## HTML Tags

### Address Tag

<address>
  1 Infinite Loop<br /> Cupertino, CA 95014<br /> United States
</address>

### Anchor Tag (aka. Link)

This is an example of a [link](http://github.com "Github").

### Abbreviation Tag

The abbreviation CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets".

*[CSS]: Cascading Style Sheets

### Cite Tag

"Code is poetry." ---<cite>Automattic</cite>

### Code Tag

You will learn later on in these tests that `word-wrap: break-word;` will be your best friend.

### Strike Tag

This tag will let you <strike>strikeout text</strike>.

### Emphasize Tag

The emphasize tag should _italicize_ text.

### Insert Tag

This tag should denote <ins>inserted</ins> text.

### Keyboard Tag

This scarcely known tag emulates <kbd>keyboard text</kbd>, which is usually styled like the `<code>` tag.

### Preformatted Tag

This tag styles large blocks of code.

<pre>
.post-title {
  margin: 0 0 5px;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 38px;
  line-height: 1.2;
  and here's a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how the PRE tag handles it and to find out how it overflows;
}
</pre>

### Quote Tag

<q>Developers, developers, developers&#8230;</q> &#8211;Steve Ballmer

### Strong Tag

This tag shows **bold text**.

### Subscript Tag

Getting our science styling on with H<sub>2</sub>O, which should push the "2" down.

### Superscript Tag

Still sticking with science and Isaac Newton's E = MC<sup>2</sup>, which should lift the 2 up.

### Variable Tag

This allows you to denote <var>variables</var>.
